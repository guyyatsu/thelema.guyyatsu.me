Tiphareth shows the full establishment and balance of the idea of the suit. This is particularly the case with this card, as the intel lect itself is also referred to the number Six.

The hilts of the Swords, which are very ornamental, are in the form of the hexagram. Their points touch the outer petals of a red rose upon a golden cross of six squares, thus showing the Rosy Cross as the central secret of scientific truth.

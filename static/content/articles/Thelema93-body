WHEEL AND WHOA!
The Great Wheel of Samsara.
The Wheel of the Law.
The Wheel of the Taro.
The Wheel of the Heavens.
The Wheel of Life.
All these Wheels be one;
yet of all these the Wheel of the TARO alone avails thee consciously.
Meditate long and broad and deep, 0 man, upon this Wheel, 
revolvig it in thy mind!
Be this thy task, to see how each card springs necessarily from each other card,
even in due order from The Fool unto The Ten of Coins.
Then, when thou know'st the Wheel of Destiny complete,
may'st thou perceive THAT Will which moved it first.
[There is no first or last.]
And lo!
Thou art past through the Abyss.
